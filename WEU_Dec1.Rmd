<h3><strong>Canadian economic indicators</strong></h3>

<a id="section-b"></a>
<ul>
  <li>Canada’s third quarter GDP contracted by 0.3% driven by a 25.4% drop in refined petroleum exports and 18.5% drop in investment in inventories. Higher housing investments (+2.0%) and flat household spending partially offset these losses.
  </li> 
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Real GDP edged up 0.1% in September driven by the goods-producing industries (+0.3%) while the services-producing industries remained essentially unchanged. Advance information indicates that real GDP increased by 0.2% in October, as increases in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, retail trade, and construction were only partially offset by decreases in wholesale trade.
  </li> 
</ul>

<ul>  
<a id="section-c"></a>
  <li>The unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points to 5.8%, continuing its upward trend since April. The employment rate fell by 0.1 percentage points to 61.8% in November, as the growth of the population continued to outpace employment growth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>On a year-over-year basis, average hourly wages (not seasonally adjusted) rose by 4.8% (or $1.57) to $34.28 in November, following a similar increase in October (+4.8%).
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Job vacancies dropped by 6.1% to 632,000 and average weekly earnings remained unchanged at $1,219. At the sector level, the largest decline in vacancies was observed in accommodation and food services (-15,000; -18.8%), construction (-10,800; -17.3%), finance and insurance (-9,800; -39.2%), and public administration (-2,400; -14.8%).
  </li>
</ul>
<a id="section-a"></a>
<ul>
  <li> In November, small business optimism fell 3.4 points to 37.7 for the next 3-months, and fell 1.5 points to 45.6 for the next 12-months. Nearly half of businesses stated that insufficient domestic demand was constraining sales, and taxes and wages were cited among the top input cost constraints. </li>
  </li>

<h3><strong> U.S. economic news</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>US real GDP increased at an annual rate of 5.2% in the third quarter of 2023 according to the “second” estimate, well above the 2.1% gain realized in the previous quarter and the fastest pace on record since the fourth quarter of 2021.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims for unemployment insurance was 218,000 during the week ending November 25, up 7,000 from the previous week’s revised level.</li>

<h3><strong>Economic reports</strong></h3>

<h5><strong>1) Self-employment among women in Canada</strong></h5>
<ul>
  <li> [A recent Statistics Canada study](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2023001/article/00014-eng.pdf) examined self-employment among women—including its growth, occupations, and the differences among women with different characteristics—found that **a growing share of women are becoming self-employed. In 2022, 37% of all self-employed individuals were women, up from 26% in 1976. Despite this growth, women remain less likely to be in self-employment than men. In 2022, 11% of employed women were self-employed, compared to 16% for employed men.**  
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This study also shows evidence on **persisting gender-specific labour market segregation.** In 2022, self-employed women were shown to be overrepresented in female-dominated occupations, such as being childcare providers. By contrast, in the same year, self-employed men were reported to be mostly working in historically male-dominated occupations, such as home building and renovation managers. Self-employed men were also reported to worked as managers in agriculture and as transport truck drivers more often than women. 
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> **Self-employment among women also differed by age.** In 2022, 2% of young women (aged 15 to 24 years) in the labour force were self-employed, down from 5% in 1976. By contrast, the self-employment rate among older women (aged 55 years and over) increased from 14% to 18% over the same period. With respect to various groups, self-employment varied little among Indigenous women (9%), racialized women (10%) and non-racialized, non-Indigenous women (12%). However, there are differences within the racialized groups and Indigenous women. Among racialized groups, Korean women are most likely to be self-employed, with one in five (20%) in self-employment, while Filipino women (5%) and Black women (6%) are least likely. With respect to Indigenous women, self-employment rate among women stood at 7% for First Nations people living off reserve, 10% for Métis women, and 4% for Inuit women.
  </li>
</ul>
